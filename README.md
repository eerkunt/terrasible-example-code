# terrasible :: Example Code

This repository created to demonstrate automated build & deployment capability of the configuration that has been given in `terrasible` repository.

Any changes will trigger Travis CI to see if the build is successful, then `deploy.sh` in `terrasible` repository will check if there is a new build in Travis CI in order to deploy it.

So, pretty nothing much here. :)
